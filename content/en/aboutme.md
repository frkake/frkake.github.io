Since fallen objects are not specific predefined items, the challenge was exploring methods to detect such unknown objects. Proposed and implemented various detection approaches, from which a primary approach was selected. Implemented and evaluated a novel proposed method, handling everything from data collection and annotation to implementation and evaluation."},
    {name = "Highway Surveillance Camera Image Analysis", description = "Developed a system to detect road anomalies (wrong-way driving, fallen objects, etc.) from object detection results in highway CCTV cameras. Extracted driving paths by analyzing vehicle trajectories using 2D bounding boxes from object detection results, and performed 3D bounding box conversion. Using these techniques, built a system to estimate wrong-way driving and vehicle speed."},
